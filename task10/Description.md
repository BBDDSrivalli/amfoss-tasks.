# Code Explanation

The following script processes a series of images to find and connect dots based on their positions and colors. It performs the following steps: 1. **Imports**: The necessary libraries are imported. 2. **`sort_images` Function**: Retrieves and sorts images by numeric values in filenames. 3. **`find_dot` Function**: Identifies the dot's position and color within an image. 4. **`main` Function**: Coordinates the image processing and generates a final stitched image. 5. **Entry Point**: Ensures the `main()` function runs only when the script is executed directly.

## Imports

The necessary libraries are imported: - **cv2**: For image processing. - **numpy**: For numerical operations. - **os**: For file system interactions. - **re**: For regular expressions. - **PIL**: For image creation and manipulation.

```python
import cv2 as cv
import numpy as np
import os
import re
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

## sort_images Function

This function retrieves the list of images from the specified folder and sorts them by the numeric values in their filenames. This ensures that the images are processed in the correct sequence.

```python
def sort_images(image_folder):
    images = os.listdir(image_folder)
    images.sort(key=lambda x: int(re.search(r'\d+', x).group()))
    return images

## find_dot Function

This function processes each image to find the dot's position and its color. It converts the image to grayscale, applies a binary threshold to isolate the dot, finds contours, and calculates the center of the largest contour (the dot). The color of the dot is also extracted.

```python
def find_dot(image):
    gray_image = cv.cvtColor(image, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    _, thresholded_image = cv.threshold(gray_image, 200, 255, cv.THRESH_BINARY_INV)
    contours, _ = cv.findContours(thresholded_image, cv.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    for contour in contours:
        x, y, w, h = cv.boundingRect(contour)
        center_x = x + w // 2
        center_y = y + h // 2
        mask = np.zeros(image.shape[:2], dtype=np.uint8)
        cv.drawContours(mask, [contour], -1, color=255, thickness=-1)
        mean_color = cv.mean(image, mask=mask)[:3]
        return (center_x, center_y), tuple(map(int, mean_color))
    return None, None
## main Function

This is the core function where everything comes together. It initializes the image processing by sorting the images, creating a blank canvas, and processing each image to find dots. Lines are drawn between consecutive dots, and the final image is saved.
```pyton
def main():
    image_folder = 'Operation-Pixel-Merge/assets'
    images = sort_images(image_folder)

    dot_positions = []
    dot_colors = []
    canvas_size = (512, 512)
    
    # Create a blank canvas
    canvas = Image.new("RGB", canvas_size, "white")
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(canvas)
    
    for i, image_name in enumerate(images):
        image_path = os.path.join(image_folder, image_name)
        image = cv.imread(image_path)
        
        # Check if the image is completely white (line break)
        if np.mean(image) == 255:
            dot_positions.append(None)
            dot_colors.append(None)
            continue
        
        # Find the dot and its color
        dot_position, dot_color = find_dot(image)
        if dot_position and dot_color:
            dot_positions.append(dot_position)
            dot_colors.append(dot_color)
        
        # Draw lines between consecutive dots
        if i > 0 and dot_positions[i-1] and dot_positions[i]:
            draw.line([dot_positions[i-1], dot_positions[i]], fill=dot_colors[i-1], width=2)

    # Save the final image
    canvas.save('stitched_image.png')
    print("Stitched image saved as stitched_image.png")

## Entry Point

This line ensures that the main() function is called only when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
