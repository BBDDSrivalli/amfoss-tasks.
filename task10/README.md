# Required Installations and Usage

## Setup

**Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository using Git: ```bash git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git ``` Navigate into the cloned repository directory: ```bash cd repository-name ```

**Create the Environment:** Create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies: ```bash python -m venv env ```

**Activate the Environment:** Activate the virtual environment:```bash  source env/bin/activate ```

## Install Dependencies

**OpenCV (cv2):** Installation: ```bash pip install opencv-python ``` Usage: OpenCV is used for various image processing tasks such as converting images to grayscale, applying thresholds, finding contours, and performing other manipulations.

**NumPy (np):** Installation: ```bash pip install numpy ``` Usage: NumPy is essential for numerical computations and array operations. In this code, it is used to handle image data, create masks, calculate mean colors, and check image conditions.

**Pillow (PIL):** Installation: ```bash pip install Pillow ``` Usage: Pillow adds image processing capabilities. It is used to create a blank canvas, draw lines between points, and save the final stitched image.

**os and re Libraries (Standard Python Libraries):** os: Facilitates interaction with the operating system, such as file handling. re: Provides tools for regular expression operations, useful for extracting numbers from filenames for sorting.

## Code Overview

The provided Python code performs the following tasks:

- **Image Processing**: The code processes a sequence of images to detect dots and then stitches these images into a single output image.
- **Image Conversion**: Each image is converted to grayscale and thresholded to isolate the dots from the background.
- **Contour Detection**: The code finds contours in the thresholded image and calculates the center of the largest contour as the dot's location.
- **Image Stitching**: A blank canvas is created, and lines are drawn between consecutive dots detected across images. White images indicate line breaks and are skipped.
- **Saving the Result**: The final stitched image is saved as `stitched_image.png`.

## Thinking and Logic Behind the Code

- **Sorting Images**: The images are sorted based on numeric values in their filenames to ensure proper processing order.
- **Finding Dots**: Images are processed to find dots by converting them to grayscale, applying a threshold, and detecting contours. The dot's location is determined from the contour's center.
- **Stitching Images**: Lines are drawn on a blank canvas to connect detected dots. Images that are completely white are skipped to prevent unnecessary drawing.
- **Saving the Image**: The final stitched image, showing the sequence of dots, is saved as `stitched_image.png`.
