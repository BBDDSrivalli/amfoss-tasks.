<strong>Approach and Experience</strong>
Despite focusing on algorithms and syntax, this task took longer to complete than anticipated.
Even without learning every programming language in depth, I found that understanding core algorithms and their implementation was crucial. 
To navigate the challenges, I relied heavily on resources such as YouTube, Google, and ChatGPT.
These tools provided invaluable support, helping me efficiently grasp language-specific syntax and concepts, which significantly aided in completing the task.

 I also enjoyed exploring these resources and these many languages :)
